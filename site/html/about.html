<p><h1>About Me</h1></p>
<p>
My name is Will Boulton and I am a software engineer and mathematician. 
I finished my BA and MMath at the University of Cambridge in 2016. Since then 
I have been working as a software engineer, as well as doing mathematical modelling and data science type
things. 
<br/>
<br/>
This website is a huge mish-mash of topics I am interested in as well as a place for my to collect together various 
articles I am reading, or want to read. Occasionally there might be some useful information for my maths students. 
I will put stuff on this website that I'm excited to find out more about, and mainly hope that this website can be used
to help other students in a similar situation. 
<br/>numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

<br/>
The sort of areas I am interested in include:
<ul>
    <li>molecular biology, genomics, biochemistry, and molecular dynamics</li>
    <li>applied mathematics, particularly in life science</li>
    <li>bioinformatics and computational biology</li>
    <li>machine learning and data science</li>
    <li>applied category theory, and category theory in computer science</li>
    <li>coalgebra</li>
    <li>recreational mathematics</li>
    <li>programming, mainly in Python</li>
    <li>computer science</li>
</ul>
Each of these are massive areas!
<br/>
<br/>
As a software engineer I mainly program in Python and Java, though I have occasionally played around with 
Javascript, C and C++. I have some interest in Haskell, due to its connection to category theory, which I've remained interested in
since university.

You can contact me at <a href=mailto:wboulton12@gmail.com>wboulton12@gmail.com</a> if you like, 
and if you spot any mistakes in this website and want to tell me then I will be very grateful. 
Please email me if you want a copy of my CV for some reason. 
My github is pretty empty, but you can find it <a href=https://github.com/willboulton>here</a>. 
I rarely use Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram 
(because they are stupid) so don't bother trying to contact me on any of those.
