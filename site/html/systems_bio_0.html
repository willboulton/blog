<h1 id="Systems-Biology-Lecture-0">Systems Biology Lecture 0<a class="anchor-link" href="#Systems-Biology-Lecture-0">&#182;</a></h1><p>This is a set of lecture notes from a 2014 course on systems biology from MIT, lectured by Prof. Jeff Gore. You can find it <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-591j-systems-biology-fall-2014/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first lecture is a bit of an overview of the course.</p>
<p>I am just going to go over the highlights in these notes, and I would recommend anyone who is really interested to look at the course on the link above, or search for it on Youtube.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-systems-biology?">What is systems biology?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-systems-biology?">&#182;</a></h2><p>One thing Jeff gets really excited by right at the start of the lecture is a <a href="https://youtu.be/gc3O2sKIsX4?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63OI3pSKo8Ha_DFBMxm23xO&amp;t=83">video of a neutrophil chasing around a bacterium</a> in some blood. This is really amazing! How can a single cell make these complex decisions and chase another cell? This is the sort of behaviour that systems biology aims to understand.</p>
<p>Systems biology uses simple models from nonlinear dynamics and physics to model simple cells, genes, and cell-interactions.</p>
<h3 id="Course-description">Course description<a class="anchor-link" href="#Course-description">&#182;</a></h3><blockquote><p>"Introduction to cellular and population-level systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modelling of genetic networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics. Cellular systems include genetic switches and oscillators, network motifs, genetic network evolution, and celular decision-making. Population-level systems include models of pattern formation, cell-cell communication, and evolutionary systems biology." - Prof. Jeff Gore</p>

</ul>
<p>Qn. What is the characteristic timescale for these sort of activations/ repressions to occur?</p>
<p>Ans. Of order on the cell generation time, i.e. timescale of the cell cycle. (Which varys depending on the type of cell but is roughly an hour for a bacterium.)</p>
<p>B. Negative autoregulation $\text{aTc} \dashv \text{TetR-gfp} \dashv \text{TetR-gfp}$</p>
<p>TetR-gfp is a <em>fusion protein</em>.</p>
<p>Autoregulation can decreate response time.</p>

<p>From two genes repressing one another, you can make a toggle switch! This is probably the smallest component of computer memory, it is something a little bit like a <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~eedwards/compsys/memory/latches.html">latch</a> or something.</p>
<p>With three genes repressing one another in a circular fashion, you get oscillations as the states mutually repress one another. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\text{gfp} \dashv \text{bfp} \dashv \text{rfp} \dashv \text{gfp}$</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called a repressilator! It is very cool. But if you do this with colonies of e-coli, they get out of phase with one another. Elowitz came up with this - and through this found about the importance of noise in the decision making of cells. (The three proteins are differently coloured but otherwise basically the same.)</p>
<p>Ulon and Barabasi looked for motifs within gene regulatory networks, and found a lot of interesting ones. We will look at the feed-forward loop motif:</p>
$$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \text{ and } A \rightarrow C$$<p>A conclusion to all of these things: <strong>Life is noisy</strong>. You can do the same experiment twice and get very different answers just due to noise in molecular scale gene expression.</p>
<p>Another conclusion: <strong>Life is different if you are small</strong>. A case in point, Reynold's number changes a lot with scale (at bacterial scale, $\mathcal{Re} = 10^{-4}$ and water is sticky like treacle).</p>
<h2 id="Turing-Patterns-and-bigger-things">Turing Patterns and bigger things<a class="anchor-link" href="#Turing-Patterns-and-bigger-things">&#182;</a></h2><p>We will look at these in the course; we are also going to look at systems biology in ecology (we'll look at more papers by Uri Alon, including a paper on the evolution of optimal expression level).</p>
<ul>
<li>### Stochasticity in systems biology</li>
</ul>
<p>Qn. Why do we need to consider stochasticity in populations of approx. $10^9$ individuals? Should this not just wash out (like in thermodynamics)?</p>
<p>Ans. Every mutant starts out as a single individual. This means that there is always a time where populations are subject to stochastic fluctuations, which can be very important.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>### Fitness Landscapes
This is another important concept - with enough individuals, there may be a path that evolution takes, to improve its fitness in the huge landscape of all possible genomes. 
There may also be <em>game interactions</em>, i.e. concepts from game theory are important. And there can be examples in populations of 'psychopathic' individuals.</p>
