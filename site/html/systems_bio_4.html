<li>Auto-repression - oscillates only with decay - aka negative autoregulation</li>
<li>Repressilator - noisy oscillator</li>
<li>Relaxation Oscillators (both robust and tunable)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Negative-Autoregulation">Negative Autoregulation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Negative-Autoregulation">&#182;</a></h3><p>What do we like about oscillations? You can make clocks, and clocks are useful! Oscillations are also interesting from a dynamical standpoint. In real life, the circadian oscillator is a gene network which keeps track of the day-night cycle. People have even managed to produce circadian oscillations in vitro, using only proteins and genes and in abscence of any organism, which is very cool.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a situation like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>$$\dot{p} = \frac{\alpha}{1+p^n} - p$$
This is the simplest model we could write down to describe an autoregulatory loop - $P \dashv P$. 
Even without analysing this, we can already say that this will not have any oscillations, because the equation is of the form $\dot{p} = f(p)$, and this is single valued - for a single value of $p$, there is only one value of $\dot{p}$, and in any oscillatory regime, we must be able to get different values of $\dot{p}$ for a single value of $p$. It simply is not possible to get oscilations in this scenario.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What about in 2 dimensions?</p>
</li>
</ol>
$$\dot{m} = \frac{\alpha}{1+p^n} - m$$$$\dot{p} = -\beta(p - m)$$<p>mRNA is being autoregulated by a protein, but then the protein is being produced by the mRNA.</p>
<p>Question: Would we expect that $\beta &lt; 1$ or $\beta &gt; 1$, given that proteins are typically much more stable than mRNA? The answer is that typically $\beta \ll 1$, as this (non-dimensional) parameter is just the ratio $\frac{\text{lifetime of mRNA}}{\text{lifetime of protein}}$. Note that the $(p-m)$ term can be factored because we are able to choose the unit of concentration for $m$, which will depend on the transcription rate and also on $K_d$, the dissociation constant (for $m$).</p>
<p>Oscillations are possible in this two parameter space (though it turns out that there are no oscillations in this particular set of equations).</p>
<p>Let's let $f(m,p) = \frac{\alpha}{1+p^n} - m$, and $g(m,p) = -\beta(p - m)$. We are going to do some standard 1a fixed point analysis on the fixed points of this system. Solving;</p>
<ul>
<li>$m_0 = p_0$</li>
<li>$p_0(1+p_0^n) = \alpha$ </li>
</ul>
<p>at the fixed points $(m_0, p_0)$.</p>
<p>One very important point is that trajectories cannot cross one another (this is analogous to the situation in 1d where the function needed to be single valued), and in two dimensions this is a very strict criterion. In fact, this is why you basically need 3 dimensions to get chaos. The Poincare-Bendixon criterion can be used in 2d, which tells us that there are no oscillations iff the fixed point is stable. If the fixed point is unstable, you get a stable limit cycle oscilation.</p>
<p><strong>Plot a graph please!</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, the long and short of this is that we get oscillations iff our fixed points are unstable. So let's linearise around our fixed points.</p>
<p>Define $\epsilon = m - m_0$, $\eta = p - p_0$. We get a linearised matrix equation:</p>
$$\begin{pmatrix} \dot{\epsilon} \\ \dot{\eta} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; X \\ \beta &amp; -\beta \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} \epsilon \\ \eta \end{pmatrix}$$<p>,</p>
<p>where $X = -\frac{n\alpha p_0^{n-1}}{(1 + p_0^n)^2}$.</p>
<p>This is stable iff $\beta + X &gt; 0$, but by inspection this is always true - therefore there are no limit cycle oscillations.</p>
<p>N.B. limit cycle oscillations are mathematically nice and quite different to what are called neutrally stable orbits, which are (in the linear case) oscillations with purely imaginary eigenvalues; these appear in the Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey cycles and are less interesting because they are in some sense less robust in that small changes to the eigenvalues will push these into spirals or become unstable. Limit cycles are important in chaos and are 'nice'.</p>
<p>If you introduce an explicit delay, or just add more intermediate steps (for mRNA $\to$ something else $\to$ protein), then you can get oscillations just using negative autoregulation.</p>

<li>$X \dashv Y \dashv Z \dashv X$</li>
<li><p>there's a bit of abuse of notation, in some previous lectures we used this to mean that the repression was repressed - here we just mean three separate repression 'equations'.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elowitz created a system in vitro doing this, using GFP and IPTG to synchronise the starting signal. However, he found that due to noise there was a phase drift, and he got damped oscillations. This led him to look at the single cell level, and he found that they do indeed oscillate, but not very well. Only 40% of the cells were showing oscillations, and the period of oscillations was very noisy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to analyse the 'protein only' symmetric version of the repressilator - because the full version uses a 6x6 matrix which is a bit unweildy.</p>
<ol>
<li>$$\dot{p_1} = -p_1 + \frac{\alpha}{1+p_3^n}$$</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>$$\dot{p_2} = -p_2 + \frac{\alpha}{1+p_1^n}$$</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>$$\dot{p_3} = -p_3 + \frac{\alpha}{1+p_2^n}$$</li>
</ol>
<p>The fixed points can be computed explicitly.</p>
<p>There are three eigenvalues, and we get basically the same thing that we had before:</p>
$$\begin{pmatrix} \dot{\epsilon_1} \\ \dot{\epsilon_2} \\ \dot{\epsilon_3} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; X \\ X &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; X &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2  \\ \epsilon_3 \end{pmatrix}$$<p>.</p>
<p>$X$ is the same $X$ as before. We need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix, we get from the characteristic equation that:</p>
$$-(1+\lambda)^3 + X^3 = 0$$<p>and so if we <strong>plot this in the complex plane</strong>,  we see that as long as $\frac{|X|}{2} &lt; 1$, all of the eigenvalues will have real part less than 0, and so the fixed point will be stable. Remembering the definition of $X$, we see that as long as $n \gtrsim 2, \alpha \gg 1$, we get oscillations.</p>
