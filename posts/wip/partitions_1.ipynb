    "# Partition Numbers 1\n",

    "This is based on a lecture I gave for some 6th formers in 2017.\n",

    "Mathematicians are often stereotyped as people who like to count things; generally speaking this is an incorrect judgement and mathematics as a subject goes far further than 'accounting-like' tasks. However, in this talk I am going to talk about a very classical subject, dating back to Euler and even before - and this subject area called arithmetic number theory is in fact to do with ways of counting things. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ways of counting stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a pretty simple question; if I've got 5 identical beads, how many ways can I split them up into different piles? Well, here are some different combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5\n",
    "- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n",
    "- 2 + 3\n",
    "- 4 + 1\n",
    "- some other ways?\n",
    "\n",
    "After listing a few, we should probably try to approach this problem at least a little bit methodically, so I'm going to start with 1 pile (5) and work my way up to 5 piles (1+1+1+1+1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5\n",
    "- 4 + 1\n",
    "- 3 + 2\n",
    "- 3 + 1 + 1\n",
    "- 2 + 2 + 1\n",
    "- 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n",
    "- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We've done this systematically, counting down from the largest number, and always using the largest values where possible, so we've definitely not left any possibilities out. So that's the answer; there are 7 ways to split 5 beads into various piles. If you wanted to write this using mathematical notation, you could summarise this by writing that p(5) = 7, where we are defining p as a function which takes a natural number n as input and returns the number of ways of writing n.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, these 'possible ways' are called partitions, and the number of ways (as described by this function p) is called the partition function. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might reasonably ask \"What is the point of this?\". That's a completely fair question. In many branches of mathematics, and science more generally, it's common to start off with some daft question, and generalise it, or ask some follow up question, until things become both more difficult, but also more interesting and applicable to the real world. In this case, there are a lot of different follow-up questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This counting process worked for 5, but what about 10, or 200, or a million? Is there a general pattern / a formula? If you graph these, what's the general shape of the graph?\n",
    "2. Is there a way of speeding up this counting process? Or say someone wants to know the same problem but with 6 instead of 5, do I have to do all of the work again, or does knowing the answer with 5 help?\n",
    "3. What if the order doesn't matter? So that you're allowed 4 + 1 and 1 + 4 as being different and 2 + 2 + 1 is different to 2 + 1 + 2 which is different to 1 + 2 + 2. Is there a formula then?\n",
    "4. What if you're only allowed to use different numbers (no repeats)? What if you're only allowed to use odd numbers? Or only allowed to use even numbers? Or square numbers? Or some other restriction?\n",
    "\n",
    "To use more technical terminology, we want to generalise this question in different ways: using any number (call it n) instead of 5 (Q1), having more (or less) restrictive rules on how to divide up n (Q3 and Q4), and asking for a closed formula (Q1), asymptotic equation (Q1), and an efficient algorithm to compute these numbers, or a recursive algorithm; we'd also like to know the runtime of the algorithm (Q2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before reading on, you should try to investigate some of these questions for yourself. You could try computing some of these numbers by hand and drawing out a table, or writing a computer program to do it for you, and graphing the results. In particular, you could try Q3, and draw out a table for Q4 using either only even numbers, only odd numbers, or only distinct numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're still reading this I'm assuming you either got bored of trying the question yourself, or you did it. Either way, here's how I approached the problem of counting the partitions of a natural number, where you are allowed repeated entries in the sum, and the order of the summands matters (i.e. question 3 above). \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, just work out the first few possibilities. I'll write n for the number we're testing, and r(n) for the number of ways of making n when you're allowed repeats:"

    "It looks like the pattern here is powers of two -  $ r(n) = 2 ^ {n-1} $. Great! Are we finished? Unfortunately, just working out the first 4 terms in a sequence and spotting a pattern doesn't really constitute a proof. That kind of logic can be pretty persuasive to set up a hypothesis, but for a mathematician, there's still plenty of work left to do. To be sure, we need to come up with a foolproof argument for why our guess for this formula of r(n) is right. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Back to Partitions\n",
    "Let's define a set of functions:\n",
    "    Given an input n (the symbol means \"is an element of\" and the N is the set of natural numbers, so 1, 2, 3, 4, ...etc.) let's define-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - p(n) is the number of partitions of n\n",
    "    - r(n) is the number of partitions of n where re-orderings are allowed\n",
    "    - e(n) is the number of partitions of n using only even numbers\n",
    "    - o(n) is the number of partitions of n using only odd numbers\n",
    "    - d(n) is the number of partitions of n using only distinct numbers (no repeats allowed)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already worked out an exact formula for r(n) - it's 2 ** (n-1). So that's an open and shut case. Are there any other easy things we can think of? Well, e(n) is pretty obviously going to be 0 whenever n is odd (you can't make an odd number by adding together a bunch of even numbers), and when n is even, e(n) is just the same thing as p(n/2) (divide all your piles in half). So we have a complete formula for e(n) too: \n",
    "\n",
    "e(n) = { 0 if n is odd; p(n/2) if n is even;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another general mathematical principle - reducing one problem to another. I don't have a formula for e(n) but I do know that it's almost the same as p(n/2); so actually the e(n) problem is no harder or easier than working things out for p(n). \n",
    "\n",
    "What about these other ones though? I've drawn out a table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "How weird. It looks like there are just as many ways of splitting a number up into odd parts as there are for splitting it up into distinct (ie. different) parts. That's pretty crazy. In fact it's so crazy that it's probably worth investigating a bit more. I've written a computer program which does this, and prints the results. The code is in the appendix, but the results are given here below. If you're keen, and know some coding, I'd suggest you write your own code to check this too. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Appendix - Some coding\n",
    "Being able to code is a pretty useful skill for almost every technical or scientific field. If you know a little bit of coding, I would strongly encourage you to try to write programs that can calculate partition numbers. I've put some code in a github repository which you are free to mess with as much as you like. However, if you don't know any coding, you can still get started a bit. Just make sure you do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a new tab in your browser.\n",
    "2. Go on the three dots next to the url bar, click it and look for \"Developer Tools\". In Chrome, it's under \"More Tools\" > \"Developer Tools\" and the shortcut is Control + Shift + I. \n",
    "3. Click the Console tab. This opens an interactive console where you can type in any valid javascript code and the console will evaluate it for you. \n",
    "4. Try typing in some maths operations like 2 + 2, or 6 ** 3 (to run that line of code you need to hit enter). \n",
    "5. Type in the command: \n",
    "\n",
    "{% highlight javascript %}\n",
    "fetch().then(response => response.text).then()\n",
    "{% endhighlight %}\n",
    "\n",
    "This copies the code from http://sekjsjf directly into the console. You can now use that code even if you don't understand exactly what it does! (This is 99% of programming.)\n",
    "6. Still in the console, type in Partitions.partition(5) and hit enter. The console should return 7 as the answer. But there are a whole load of other functions that you can try using. There's a handy autocomplete function, and a drop down, showing you a range of available options. Try typing in Partitions.partition.text(), Partitions.odd.text(), Partitions.distinct.text() to get a short description of what each function does. \n",
    "7. Try using some other commands. Writing Partitions.odd(5, list=True) will return [1,2,3,4,5]; i.e. rather than just calculating the answer for 5 it will run through all the numbers up to 5 and return the answers for each in an array. \n",
    "8. What about if we want to check that d(n) = o(n) for every single number up to 100? We could try writing some code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "{% highlight javascript %}\n",
    "for (let i = 1; i < 100; i = i + 1) {\n",
    "    if (Partitions.odd(i) === Partitions.distinct(i)) {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Same\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        console.log(\"These two are different!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "{% endhighlight %}\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of good javascript tutorials (here's just one) but as a super crash course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single equals sign assigns a variable a value. i = 1 assigns the variable i a value of 1. \n",
    "- triple equals checks for equality. So something like (2 + 2 === 4) evaluates as true. \n",
    "- for (let i = 1; i < 100; i++) {do some stuff} looks more intimidating, but it's still pretty simple. We start by creating a new variable called i and giving it the value 1 (let i = 1;). Next we do whatever is in the curly brackets. Once that's done, we add 1 to the value of i (that's the  i = i + 1, which looks weird, but remember that a single equals sign in javascript is an assignment, so really this is saying \"I want you to assign the variable i a new value, by taking its current value and adding 1 to it\"). Then we evaluate what's in the curly brackets, using the updated value for i. We keep doing this until i reaches 100 ( i < 100;), when we can stop. \n",
    "- if (something) {do this} else {do that} is pretty self explanatory. If the condition inside the if (something) is evaluated as true, we do what's inside the first set of brackets. Otherwise, we do whatever the else part says. \n",
    "- console.log(\"whatever\") just tells the console to print out that line. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the code here, we assign a new variable called i the value 1. Then we check if Partitions.odd(i) and Partitions.distinct(i) are equal, and if they are we print \"Same\", otherwise we print \"These two are different!\". Then we add 1 to the value of i (that's the i = i + 1 part) and do it again. We keep on doing this until i hits 100, when we can stop. One thing to note is that in javascript (and in programming in general) adding 1 to a variable is so common that it has a shorthand - rather than writing i = i + 1, you can write i++, which is more compact but means the same thing.
