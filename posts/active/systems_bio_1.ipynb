If you add equations 1 and 2 together, you get that $d[E]_{T}/dt = 0$ i.e. $[E]_T$ is constant, which is kind of obvious; enzyme does not get used up in a reaction so the total amount (in either the bound or unbound state) must be conserved. The subscript T stands for \"total\", and means the total concentration of that substance, both in the bound and unbound state. So for example $[S]_T = [S] + [ES]$. \n",

    "#### REDO THIS BECAUSE IT IS WRONG!\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on part 3. We are going to prove this rigourously by looking at the differential equations and then using L'Hopital's rule. However, it is also instructive to do this in another way, which may be less rigourous, but is also much faster and more broadly applicable; dimensional analysis. Imagine we only have 1 molecule of enzyme in an otherwise plentiful supply of substrate, and we want to know $f_B$, which essentially means the proportion of the time that our molecule is in the bound state. Collisions are more likely to occur when the concentration of $S$ is higher, in fact we can be more precise and say that this will be proportional to $\\sqrt{S}$. (Why? Because...) So $f_B \\propto \\sqrt{S}$. Also note that it will certainly depend on the forewards and backwards rates, increasing with the forewards rate since that drives the binding of enzyme, and decreasing with the backwards rate. So since $K_d$ is (one over) the ratio of these quantities, and to get the dimensions to work out, we can guess that $f_B \\propto \\sqrt{S/K_d}$. There might be a constant of proportionality, but let's just guess that this is $1$. \n",

A lot of the time we might just forget about $X^*$, since it gets produced quickly, and we're not really interested in it per se; we only really care about the effect of the activation levels of $X$ and expression levels of $Y$, and may equivocate $X$ and $X^*$, and $Y$ and $Y^*$. \n",
